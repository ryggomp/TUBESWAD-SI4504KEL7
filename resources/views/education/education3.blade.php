                    In August 2021 Starlinger & Co GmbH received two Letters of No Objection (LNO) issued by the US Food
                    and
                    Drug Administration FDA regarding its newly developed machine concept for processing post-consumer
                    HDPE
                    scrap. The LNOs apply to the HDPE bottle-to-bottle and cap-to-cap recycling processes respectively,
                    and
                    confirm that HDPE regranulate produced with the Starlinger recycling process can be used at levels
                    of up
                    to 100 % in packaging with food contact. Already in 2012 Starlinger received its first FDA LNO for
                    the
                    use of recycled HDPE.

                    “The two LNOs are another important achievement for Starlinger in the field of food grade
                    recycling”,
                    said Paul Niedl, Commercial Head of Starlinger recycling technology. “Like it is the case with PET,
                    100
                    % recycled HDPE can now be used in applications with direct food contact. There is keen market
                    interest
                    for this - all signs are pointing towards a circular economy.”

                <p>

                    The new Starlinger machine concept consists of a recoSTAR dynamic recycling line with a C-VAC
                    degassing
                    module and downstream odour reduction technology. The removal of odours plays an important role in
                    the
                    production of food-grade recyclate made from post-consumer HDPE. “Packaging made of HDPE is used for
                    a
                    lot of foods“, explained Niedl. „If, for example, substances from food scraps migrate into the
                    plastic,
                    they can cause unpleasant smells in the recycling process. To avoid this, we use our three-step
                    procedure: It starts with material preparation, followed by highly efficient degassing in the C-VAC
                    module, and is finalized with the thermal after-treatment of the produced regranulate. This method
                    ensures that even deeply embedded odours are removed.” Contrary to methods which bind the odours by
                    means of additives and enclose them in the regranulate, the Starlinger process removes the
                    substances
                    causing the odours and delivers permanently odour-reduced pellets which do not release unwanted
                    smells
                    in the following production steps.

                    “With the development of the circular economy, HDPE bottle-to-bottle recycling will gain increasing
                    importance“, emphasised Paul Niedl. „A big share of food packaging such as milk and juice bottles,
                    bottle caps as well as food trays for meat is made of HDPE. If this packaging is returned to the
                    recycling stream and reused as food packaging without downcycling, millions of tons of virgin HDPE
                    can
                    be saved in the future.”
