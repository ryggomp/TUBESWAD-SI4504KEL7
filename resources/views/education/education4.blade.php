                    <span class="italic">Stuttgart, November 2023</span> - Coperion has successfully launched operation
                    of its new Recycling
                    Innovation Center. In this high-tech test center for plastics recycling applications, every
                    recycling process step - from material handling and feeding to extrusion, compounding, pelletizing,
                    material postprocessing and deodorization - can be tested. Extensively equipped recycling systems
                    are available that can be modified in myriad ways, depending upon the specific requirements of the
                    recyclate to be produced.

                    Coperion's new Recycling Innovation Center is the perfect complement to the Herbold Meckesheim Test
                    Center, where customers can simulate and test the mechanical pretreatment of plastic, allowing
                    customers to experience first-hand the significant reduction in organic impurities by using Herbold
                    Meckesheim's hot washing system, as an example. Herbold Meckesheim has been part of Coperion's
                    Recycling Business Unit since 2022.

                <p>
                    The Recycling Innovation Center is located in Niederbiegen near Weingarten, Germany, directly
                    adjacent
                    to Coperion's existing Test Center for Bulk Solids Handling. Along with proprietary research and
                    development projects, first tests have been performed for customers, in which new, sustainable
                    products
                    and recycling processes have been developed and tested. Coperion process engineers can modify the
                    available recycling technologies such that the recompounds are manufactured with the highest
                    efficiency
                    possible while maintaining a consistently high level of product quality. The results achieved can
                    then
                    be effortlessly scaled up to production level thanks to the constant base parameters of all Coperion
                    technologies.

                        Every new technological development from Coperion that optimizes plastics recycling has been
                        integrated into the Recycling Innovation Center's machinery and can be tested there. For
                        example, in the area of material conveying, the energy-efficient FLUIDLIFT ecodry® flash drying
                        process is available - moisture remaining in recycling grinds following the washing process is
                        reduced during material transportation. Moreover, the MIX-A-LOT bulk solid mixer, which can
                        create premixes including flakes or powders, and the innovative buffer hopper solution using the
                        ARW discharge agitator as well as the Smart Weigh Belt (SWB) feeder are integrated in the
                        system. Coperion has also installed the ZS-B MEGAfeed side feeder, especially for extruding and
                        compounding plastic recyclates with bulk densities starting as low as 20 kg/m³ at high
                        throughputs. With its innovative design, the ZS-B MEGAfeed handles flakes and fibers such that
                        they can be fed into a ZSK twin screw extruder in large quantities without energy-intensive
                        compacting.

                    “The new Recycling Innovation Center shows how important it is for us to advance technology that helps
                    our customers work towards more sustainability solutions and a functioning circular economy. The
                    Recycling Innovation Center offers the ideal environment, both for our own research and development
                    projects as well as for our customers, to master the challenges of plastics recycling”, said Frank
                    Lechner, General Manager of Process Technology and Research & Development at Coperion.

                    “With this new Recycling Innovation Center, we're in a position where we can simulate the entire
                    plastics recycling process. Our customers can test the complete process, from mechanical pretreatment of
                    plastics in Herbold Meckesheim's Test Center up to compounding and pelletizing, prior to making the
                    investment. As a supplier of entire recycling systems, we are very proud to be able to offer our
                    customers this enormous added value”, said Massimo Serapioni, General Manager of Coperion's Recycling
                    Business Unit.
